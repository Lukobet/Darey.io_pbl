#  Load Balancer Solution With Apache
 
 A Load Balancer (LB) distributes clientsâ€™ requests among underlying Web Servers and makes sure that the load is distributed in an optimal way. 

I will be enhancing tooling Website solution by adding a Load Balancer to distribute traffic between Web Servers and allow users to access our website using a single URL.
Prerequisites for this projects are the installation and configuration of the following:

1. Two RHEL8 Web Servers
2. One MySQL DB Server (based on Ubuntu 20.04)
3. One RHEL8 NFS server
